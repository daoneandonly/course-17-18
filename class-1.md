### <a name="class-1-play-a"></a> Step A

If you haven‚Äôt already, [sign up for GitHub and install a text
editor][materials].

### <a name="class-1-play-b"></a> Step B

Create a file on your computer, `username.svg` (where `username` is your GitHub
username, so in my case it would be `wooorm.svg`), and copy-paste the following
document into it.

> üíÅ Update the `<title>` element in the file with your username too.

<details>
<summary><code>username.svg</code></summary>

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!--Update the title with your username-->
  <title>@username</title>

  <!--Add stuff here-->

  <!-- NOTHING TO SEE HERE... MOVE ALONG!!! -->

### <a name="class-1-play-c"></a> Step C

Let‚Äôs make art!  Open the file created in [**step B**][c1pb] in your text editor
**and** browser.  Now, perform the following substeps.

> üíÅ The code contains a script to check how you‚Äôre doing.  Open your console
> to see how you‚Äôre progressing.

1.  Add a `<circle>` element with `cx`, `cy`, and `r` attributes
2.  Open your console‚Äôs **elements tab** and inspect your `<circle>`.  Use the
    **tree pane** to edit the values for the `cy`, `cx`, and `r` attributes
3.  Add a `<rect>` element with `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` attributes
4.  Add a `<line>` element with `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `stroke-width`, and
    `stroke` attributes
5.  Add a `<polygon>` element with a `points` attribute
6.  Add a `<path>` element with a `d` attribute
7.  Add a `<text>` element with `x` and `y` attributes, and add actual text
    to the element
8.  Add a `<g>` element with a `stroke` and `stroke-width` attribute around at
    least two of your previously added elements
9.  Add `viewBox`, `width`, and `height` attributes to your `<svg>` element
10. Add `fill`, `font-family`, `font-size`, and `opacity` attributes
    to any of the elements inside `<svg>`

> üíÅ Feel free to add more elements and attributes.  The above are the minimum.

### <a name="class-1-play-d"></a> Step D

Done with [**step C**][c1pc]?  Awesome!  You‚Äôre a true SVG artist üë©‚Äçüé®

For this step, we‚Äôre going to hand your work in.  This will [add your work to
the website][play-gallery].

1.  First remove the `<script>` element from your SVG file (including the
    CDATA inside it).
    We don‚Äôt need it anymore
2.  You can‚Äôt just change our website.
    You have to propose changes.
    On GitHub, that‚Äôs called a Pull Request.
    First, we‚Äôre going to [Fork a repo][fork].
    Navigate to our course repository on GitHub,
    [`cmda-fe3/course-17-18`][repo], and in the top-right corner of the page
    click **Fork**
3.  <a name="class-1-play-d-3"></a>
    Navigate to the directory `site/class-1-play` on your fork.
    Follow the guide [Adding a file to a repository][upload] to upload the SVG
    file you made in [**step B**][c1pb].
    For the commit message, use `Add @username` (in my case `Add @wooorm`).
    Leave the commit description empty.
    Select **Create a new branch** and use the name `play`.
    When ready, click **Commit changes**
4.  Your changes are now on your fork and not yet handed in.
    To suggest that your changes be applied to our website, create a
    [Pull Request][pr].
    Make sure that **base fork** is set to our repository, **base branch** to
    `master`, **head fork** to your repository, and **head branch** to `play`.
    Leave the comment empty and click **Create pull request**

### Complete

All done!  Our [Continuous Integration][ci] and one of our lecturers will review
your code.  We‚Äôll request changes if your code is not yet complete or [merge][]
your PR and include it in the [gallery][play-gallery].

## Loading data

[![][load-cover]][load-cover-source]

> Apple pie from above by [**@anniespratt**][load-cover-author].

In this assignment you‚Äôll learn about JSON and CSV, two commonly used data
formats.  Additionally, you‚Äôll learn to use d3 to request files.

### Synopsis

*   **Practice**
*   **Due**: 7 a.m. the day of [class 2][c2]
*   **Results**: [Gallery][load-gallery]

### Tips

*   [`d3-request`](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#requests-d3-request)
*   [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180)
    ‚Äî CSV spec
*   [ECMA 404](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm)
    ‚Äî JSON spec
*   [Examples found in the slides](https://cmda-fe3.github.io/course-17-18/class-1/)
*   [Bugs?](readme.md#bugs)

### <a name="class-1-load-a"></a> Step A

Create a directory on your computer named after your GitHub username (in my case
`wooorm`).

Create a text file `dinners.txt` in your directory and open it.

As you may have guessed, this assignment is about food!  Great!  ü•ñüßÄ

Let‚Äôs create a dataset.  Add what you had for dinner the last three days to
`dinner.txt`.  For me, that‚Äôs:

| Day                  | Dinner            |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Today                | Paneng Nua        |
| Yesterday            | Goat Cheese Salad |
| Day before yesterday | Nua Pad Ped       |

> üíÅ Add more data if you feel like it and can remember that far back!
>
> üíÅ Feel free to use Dutch, English, or any language of your choosing.
> Also: any labels are fine, this is just for you.

Words like today and yesterday make a lot of sense for humans.  For computers,
it makes more sense to use absolute dates in a standardised format like
YYYY-MM-DD.  Reformat your data to include absolute dates.  For me, that‚Äôs:

| Day        | Dinner            |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 2017-09-12 | Paneng Nua        |
| 2017-09-11 | Goat Cheese Salad |
| 2017-09-10 | Nua Pad Ped       |

### <a name="class-1-load-b"></a> Step B

Create a file, `index.csv`, in your directory and open it.
Fill it with the same data as `dinners.txt` but now structured in the [CSV][]
format: an absolute date of the dinner and what you had for dinner.

### <a name="class-1-load-c"></a> Step C

Do the same with `index.json` in the [JSON][] format.

### <a name="class-1-load-d"></a> Step D

Create a file, `index.html`, and copy-paste the following document into it.

> üíÅ Update the `<title>` element in the file with your username.

<details>
<summary><code>index.html</code></summary>

```html
<!doctype html>
<meta charset=utf8>
<!--Update the title with your username:-->
<title>@username</title>
<meta content=width=device-width,initial-scale=1 name=viewport>

<!--Link to d3 here:-->

<!--Keep this script here for now:-->
<script src=https://cmda-fe3.github.io/course-17-18/check-class-1-load.js></script>

<h1>Dinners</h1>

<!--Add your code in this script:-->
<script></script>
```

</details>

### <a name="class-1-load-e"></a> Step E

Open up your terminal and go to the directory created in [**step A**][c1la].
On macOS, you can type `cd` and a space and drag the directory in
question to your terminal and finally press enter to go there.

Then, start a [simple server][server] in your directory.  If you have [Python][]
installed, you can probably do that with:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

This exposes your files to your browser on `localhost:8000`.  Open this URL
in your browser.

> üíÅ Not working?  Have you pressed enter?

If you see an error saying that `python` isn‚Äôt found, and you‚Äôve used Ruby,
Node, or something else before see [this page][server]  on how to start a
simple server on your system.

If this all sounds unfamiliar to you, install [Node.js][node] (which includes
npm), and run:

```sh
npm install -g http-server
```

‚Ä¶in your terminal to install a simple server.  Then, run:

```sh
http-server -p 8000
```

‚Ä¶any time in the future you may need a server.

When done open up your browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`.  This should
show a message suggesting you to open your console.

> üíÅ Done with the server?  Enter <kbd>‚åÉ-C</kbd> (<kbd>Control-C</kbd>) in your
> terminal to shut it down.

### <a name="class-1-load-f"></a> Step F

Now, we‚Äôre going to add d3 to the HTML.  Add a `<script>` element pointing
to d3‚Äôs servers: `d3js.org`.  See [`d3js.org`][d3] on how to link directly
to the latest release.

> üíÅ The code contains a script to check how you‚Äôre doing.  Open your console
> to see how you‚Äôre progressing.

### <a name="class-1-load-g"></a> Step G

In this step we‚Äôre going to load the JSON and CSV created in [**step B**][c1lb]
and [**step C**][c1lc].  Use `d3.json` and `d3.csv` to load those files
respectively.

See [tips][] for more info.

In callback functions passed to `d3.json` and `d3.csv`, print the loaded data
to the console with `console.log`.

Make sure both are printed before continuing to [**step H**][c1lh].

### <a name="class-1-load-h"></a> Step H

Instead of just logging stuff to the console let‚Äôs render your data to the DOM.

I rendered `<h2>` elements with the origin of the data (JSON or CSV), then
`<h3>` elements with each date, followed by `<p>` elements with the name of
each dinner.

Feel free to use any other **semantic** markup.  You could use
[`<table>`][table]s, [`<details>`][details], [`<dl>`][dl], or something else?

You may create a file, `index.css`, to style your HTML.

> üíÅ You probably need [`document.createElement`][dce] and [`textContent`][tc].
> Feel free to dig into d3, use jQuery, or something else to render stuff to
> the DOM.

### <a name="class-1-load-i"></a> Step I

In this step, we‚Äôre going to hand your work in.  This will [add your work to
the website][load-gallery].

1.  First remove the `<script>` element referencing `check-class-1-load.js`,
    all `console.log` calls, and your HTML comments from `index.html`.
    We don‚Äôt need them anymore
2.  Go to your fork of `course-17-18` and create a new branch.
    First, make sure to switch to your `master` branch in the **Branch**
    select (just above your files to the left) if it‚Äôs not already selected.
    Then, click the **Branch** select again, and type in `load`.
    Finally, click **Create branch: load**
3.  Navigate to the directory `site/class-1-load` on GitHub
4.  <a name="class-1-load-i-4"></a>
    Create a new file by clicking on **Create new file**.
    In the **Name your file‚Ä¶** input, type `username/readme.md` (in my case
    `wooorm/readme.md`).
    In the **Edit your file‚Ä¶** area, write `# Hello World`.  What you‚Äôre writing
    is called markdown and we‚Äôll cover it in [**class 2**][c2].
    In the commit message at the bottom, use `Add readme.md for @username` (in
    my case `Add readme.md for @wooorm`).
    Keep **Commit directly to the load branch** selected
5.  Now, follow [**substep 3**][c1pd3] from [step D][c1pd] of the [Playing with
    SVG][play] assignment to upload the **files in your directory on your
    computer** (no, not the directory, the files!) to the newly created
    directory on GitHub on the `load` branch.
    In the commit message at the bottom, use `Add files for @username` (in my
    case `Add files for @wooorm`).
    Keep **Commit directly to the load branch** selected
6.  <a name="class-1-load-i-6"></a>
    Create a [Pull Request][pr] and use `Add @username` (in my case
    `Add @wooorm`) for the title.
    Make sure that **base fork** is set to our repository, **base branch** to
    `master`, **head fork** to your repository, and **head branch** to `load`

### Complete

All done!  Our [Continuous Integration][ci] and one of our lecturers will review
your code.  We‚Äôll request changes if your code is not yet complete or [merge][]
your PR and include it in the [gallery][load-gallery].

## Bar chart

[![][bar-cover]][bar-link]

> Example outcome of this assignment by [**@wooorm**](https://github.com/wooorm).

In this assignment you‚Äôll learn how charts made with d3 work by inspecting and
modifying an existing bar chart.

### Synopsis

*   **Homework**
*   **Due**: 7 a.m. the day of [class 2][c2]
*   **Results**: [Gallery][bar-gallery]

### Tips

*   [Let‚Äôs Make a Bar Chart](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/) by
    [**@mbostock**](https://github.com/mbostock)

### Description

The project you‚Äôll hand in will be similar to the one from [Loading data][load]
but this time will render a bar chart in SVG.

1.  Pick a **bar chart** (no, not another type of chart, a bar chart) from
    [d3‚Äôs example gallery][d3-examples] (tip: see the
    [Basic charts][basic-charts] section)
2.  Copy-paste the files over to your own computer and get the chart working
    (tip: you may need to start a server, see [step E][c1le] of [Loading
    data][load] on how to do that)
3.  Add a `<title>` element, or replace the one already there, with your GitHub
    username: `@username` (in my case `@wooorm`)
4.  Move the CSS and JS from the HTML into their own files: `index.css` and
    `index.js`
5.  Add a citation in `index.html` and `index.js` to the original work
6.  Try and change all values to get to understand the code (refreshing often
    to see if things break, in which case <kbd>‚åò-Z</kbd> (<kbd>Command-Z</kbd>)
    is your best friend)
7.  Make something pretty.  Add your own CSS, swap in new data, use different
    labels.  Make this graph your own
8.  Translate the JavaScript to Dutch or English in inline comments.  Link to
    the d3 docs where needed.  Document everything of importance in your own
    words
9.  Upload your files to `site/class-1-bar` (tip: see [**substep 4**][c1li4]
    through [**substep 6**][c1li6] from [step I][c1li] of the
    [Loading data][load] assignment, but this time use a branch `bar`)

### Complete

All done!  Our [Continuous Integration][ci] and one of our lecturers will review
your code.  We‚Äôll request changes if your code is not yet complete or [merge][]
your PR and include it in the [gallery][bar-gallery].
