*   **Grade**: [Rubric][]

## Description

In **assessment 1** you’ll make a [basic][] visualisation from given [data][].

You _may_ use [other data][other-data] but that probably means you’ll have to
clean it yourself.  Cleaning data is hard and we’ll cover that in [class 3][c3].
If you want to clean data, you must do so with code and hand in this code too.

We’ll check how you apply d3, whether you understand what’s happening, how well
data is represented, and quality of your code and documentation.

For this assessment you’ll build a project in a fork of
[`cmda-fe3/fe3-assessment-1`][starter-code] (**not our course repo**) and
host the project through [GitHub Pages][pages].  First, fork the repo.  Then,
work on your project and upload the final results to your fork either using
Git or the GitHub interface as covered in [class 1][c1].  You do not need
to create branches for this assessment.  You should upload files to the root
directory.

We will download your code when it’s due and check your assessment on GitHub.
You do not need to create a pull request.

## Goals

**Assessment 1** tests that you’ve attained the following knowledge:

*   [SVG and canvas][s1] (**subgoal 1**)
*   [Load external data][s2] (**subgoal 2**)
*   [Read][s3] and [write][s4] docs (**subgoal 3** and **subgoal 4**)
*   [Debug][s5] and [refactor][s6] code (**subgoal 5** and **subgoal 6**)
*   Use [scales][s7] (**subgoal 7**)

## Data

Pick one data set.  You _may_ use [other data][other-data] but that probably
means you’ll have to clean it yourself.  It’s simplest to pick any of the
cleaned data sets:

*   [Monthly temperature time series](#monthly-temperature-time-series)
*   [Top languages by number of speaker](#top-languages-by-number-of-speaker)
*   [Population without indoor toilet](#population-without-indoor-toilet)
