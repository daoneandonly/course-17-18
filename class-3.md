### Description

For this assignment you’re going to load, clean, and transform data so it can
be used in a line chart.

1.  First, copy the files `index.html` and `index.txt` from
    [`site/class-3/clean`][clean-starter] to your computer and start a simple
    server.
    If everything went OK, you should see two axes and a temperature label
    when you open the URL of your server in your web browser
2.  Update the `<title>` element with your GitHub username: `@username` (in my
    case `@wooorm`)
3.  Go to [knmi][uurgegevens] and select `260 De Bilt`, `285 Huibertgat`, and
    two other weather stations.  Select one day of your choosing by setting the
    start and end date to the same date.  Finally, click **Download dataset**,
    and replace `index.txt` in your directory with the file you just downloaded
4.  Open `index.html` in your text editor and add code to clean and transform
    data (you may start at line 105).  Do not change `index.txt` manually.
    Store the clean data in the variable `places`.
    Once your code creates the correct data, you’ll see a
    [line chart][clean-preview]
5.  When done, add a `readme.md` file similar to the one from
    [Class 2: Do you readme?!][c2readme] that additionally describes how you
    cleaned the data

Hand in your code in a directory `username` (in my case `wooorm`) to
`site/class-3-clean/` by creating a pull request from a branch `clean`.
Include `index.html`, `index.txt`, `readme.md`, and optionally a `preview.png`
file.

## Transition

### Description

The project you’ll hand in will be similar to the one from
[Class 1: Bar chart][c1bar] but this time will render a non-basic chart using
transitions.

1.  Pick a **static** (without transitions or interaction) non-basic chart from
    [d3’s example gallery][d3-examples]
2.  Copy-paste the files over to your own computer and get the chart working
3.  Add a `<title>` element, or replace the one already there, with your GitHub
    username: `@username` (in my case `@wooorm`)
4.  Move the CSS and JS from the HTML into their own files: `index.css` and
    `index.js`
5.  Add a citation in `index.html` and `index.js` to the original work
6.  Refactor the code to match your code style.  Add comments whenever you
    come across code you don’t fully understand describing how it works
7.  Now, add transitions using [`d3-transition`][d3-transition] and
    [`d3-ease`][d3-ease] so the chart appears gradually.  Make something pretty.
    Add your own CSS, swap in new data, use different labels.  Make this graph
    your own
8.  When done, add a `readme.md` file similar to the one from
    [Class 2: Do you readme?!][c2readme] that additionally describes what you
    changed and how you applied transitions and easing

Hand in your code in a directory `username` (in my case `wooorm`) to
`site/class-3-transition/` by creating a pull request from a branch
`transition`.  Include `index.html`, `index.js`, `index.css`, `readme.md`,
optionally a `preview.png` file, and a data file (such as `index.json`,
`index.csv`, `index.tsv`).
