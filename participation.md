# Participation

Participation makes up 10% of your final grade.  It’s calculated based on
whether students engage in assignments and how they perform on extra time.

## Assignments

Each assignment is graded **ok** or **not ok**.

## Extra time

Extra time makes up 20 hours in this course (± 24%).  Students can use this
time as they see fit to reach our course’s [goals][] and further their
knowledge of technology.  For example, students can peruse optional
[materials][] or entries in the **tips** section of each assignment.

As a student, you keep a log of what you learned, what resources you used, how
much effort it took to learn, and whether it fits our [goals][].

Extra time is graded **ok** or **not ok** based on whether you’re able to
convince your lecturer that you used your time wisely.
